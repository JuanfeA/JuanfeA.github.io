  <p class="about">
    I love technology in all its forms and specially its integration in daily life to help improve quality of life, business, work, and automation of tasks in any area. Supporter of constant progress and sustain of culture and history. I study software development and information systems because I wield a logical set of thinking that leads me to fair well in training and education in the area. Never someone easy to surrender when determined in achieving a goal, be it my own, a team or business related milestone!

Experience in a paid business so far has not yet been related to my area of studies. 
However, I have worked for several years on a family business,which am currently in charge, which deals with video rental and sales, along with electronics and family entertainment in general. My education plans are to study abroad,not a degree in particular but mostly focused on becoming certified in some particular field, or a very focused training in a particular area, which is why I have interest in Prime! If there is a possibility of working abroad trough, I will of course pursue such path.
